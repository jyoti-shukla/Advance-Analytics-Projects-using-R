Using the GRADES  downloaddata set, predict the value of "admit", using all other variables in the data as potential predictors, build a 

Decision Tree (using ctree function in Party in R) 
Random Forest (using randomForest in randomForest in R)
Logistic Regression (using glm in R core)
Use "set.seed(1234)" after you load your data so that we all get the same answers.

Do not split your data into training and test data. Use the entire data set to build your models.

In the Random Forest, for the prediction code, do not use the "data =" and then your data set name in the code. 

[variable] <- predict([variable for RF model], [variable for data set], type = "class")

Example:

Correct

predrf <- predict(rf, mydata, type = "class")

Incorrect

predrf <- predict(rf, data = mydata, type = "class")

After using all potential variables as predictors, remove the GRE variable. Rerun all models (Version 2) using the remaining variables.
